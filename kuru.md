# Kuru NPCs for AwesomeEli

## Garshog and Basheba (Chiefs - CR 13 together)

Garshog and Basheba are (respectively) husband and wife, as well as borther and sister. They have, together, rules the clan since they killed and consumed the last chief (thier father) some years back. Utterly loyal to each other they are inseperable - together in bed, in battle andprobably in death.
Garshog is an enormously fat man, grown obese on human flesh and using his size to fuel his dark powers. Though physically ugly he has a magnetic personality and holds the Kuru in his sway as much through words as through his personal power. Those unpersuaded by either are usually convinced by the brutal killing power of his animal companion and his mate however!

**Before Combat** She will use her sacred weapon ability to add +2, *Dueling* to the Balor's Lash (+2 to hit/dmg, +6 to trip/disarm attempts) and add +2 to her armor via sacred armor. She usually enters combat riding her Battle Companion - normally a Fiendish Giant Scorpion or Wasp (if flight would be useful).

**During Combat** While wielding a whip she has reach 15' and threatens to 15', deals full damage and can (as a standard action) perform a trip or disarm attempt which, if successful she can repeat on any other foe in range. Foes take 2d6 fire damage from any non-damaging manoever. She can also grapple with the whip and never drops it due to a failed disarm or trip combat maneuver attempt. Tripping a foe causes them to provoke AoOs. During combat she attempts to trip as often as she can, moving her mount into range to attack the tripped foes and use attacks of opportunity to keep them down and/or disarmed. She uses her swift action blessings to cast spells which her damage as well as that of her mount (Divine Power/Favor/Channel Vigor etc).<br>

## Yalok (Shaman, CR 10 alone)

Yalok is the spiritual leader of the tribe, and cousin to the chiefs. She is a skilled herbalist and poison-crafter as well as an alchemist. She provides healing and guidance for the tribe and directs the rites of appeasement to the Bloodqueen. If she is needed she provides back-up and support for the Elite Guard, but will cut and run to the chiefs if they look like they'll fall. 

Yalok, Female Kuru Shaman 11

## Tendrak, Arsha, Nialli and Obregor (Elite guard CR 10 together. With Yalok CR 12 encounter))

These four are the best of the warriors the tribe has produced. Brutal killing machines they guard the chiefs, deal with the most challenging foes and provide the solid core of the tribe's fighting force. Tactically Obregor usually charges out front to tie down as many as possible and soak up initial attacks in partnership with Tendrak while Arsha and Nialli hang back and eliminate threats from distane if they can. Both are more than able to stand their ground in close combat as well however. They will fight to the death if their tribe is seriously threatened.

Tendrak, Male Kuru Fighter 7 <br>
Arsha, Female Kuru Ranger 7 <br>
Nialli, Female Kuru Slayer 7<br>
Obregor, Male Kuru Brawler 7<br>

## Chorcat (Huntmaster, CR 10 alone)

A deadly huntsman, Chorcat is able to blend into shadows and almost disappear - striking like a snake to elimate isolated prey or capture it if necessary. He makes extensive use of the poisons that Yalok makes for the tribe to bring down foes many times his own strength. He prefers disengagement, escape and then striking from surprise should the fight become too even and will try to return and warn the tribe shoulda foe become too much for him, happily sacrificing his own forces to do so if necessary.

## Standard hunting party (CR 7, CR 11 with Chorcat)

The hunting party's primary role in the tribe is to seek out food - often intelligent food. They work well together, co-ordinate their movements and strike from stealth whenever they can. They take much of their prey alive. Their teamwork feats key well off each other to enable them to be more than the sum of their parts. They also make good use of Yalok's poisons.

## Standard warparty (CR 6, CR 11 with Elites, CR 13 with Elite + Yalok)

This ius the main attac/defence forcefor the tribe, dealing with threats as and when needed. As such they are all skilled in other ways as well (NPC levels) unlike the more specialised humters.

## Guards (Each CR 4)

These toughs are in charge og guarding prisoners and providing security within the tribe.

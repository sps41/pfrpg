# Kuru NPCs for AwesomeEli

## Garshog and Basheba (Chiefs)

Garshog and Basheba are (respectively) husband and wife, as well as borther and sister. They have, together, rules the clan since they killed and consumed the last chief (thier father) some years back. Utterly loyal to each other they are inseperable - together in bed, in battle andprobably in death.
Garshog is an enormously fat man, grown obese on human flesh and using his size to fuel his dark powers. Though physically ugly he has a magnetic personality and holds the Kuru in his sway as much through words as through his personal power. Those unpersuaded by either are usually convinced by the brutal killing power of his animal companion and his mate however!

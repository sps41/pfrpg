# Kuru NPCs for AwesomeEli

## Garshog and Basheba (Chiefs - CR 13 together)

Garshog and Basheba are (respectively) husband and wife, as well as borther and sister. They have, together, rules the clan since they killed and consumed the last chief (thier father) some years back. Utterly loyal to each other they are inseperable - together in bed, in battle andprobably in death.
Garshog is an enormously fat man, grown obese on human flesh and using his size to fuel his dark powers. Though physically ugly he has a magnetic personality and holds the Kuru in his sway as much through words as through his personal power. Those unpersuaded by either are usually convinced by the brutal killing power of his animal companion and his mate however!

Garshog, Kuru Male Sorcerer (Sylvan) 12

Basheba, Female Kuru Warpriest of the Bloodqueen 12.

## Yalok (Shaman, CR 10 alone)

Yalok is the spiritual leader of the tribe, and cousin to the chiefs. She is a skilled herbalist and poison-crafter as well as an alchemist. She provides healing and guidance for the tribe and directs the rites of appeasement to the Bloodqueen. 

Yalok, Female Kuru Shaman 11

## Tendrak, Arsha, Nialli and Obregor (Elite guard CR 10 together. With Yalok CR 12 encounter))

These four are the best of the warriors the tribe has produced. Brutal killing machines they guard the chiefs, deal with the most challenging foes and provide the solid core of the tribe's fighting force. Tactically Obregor usually charges out front to tie down as many as possible and soak up initial attacks in partnership with Tendrak while Arsha and Nialli hang back and eliminate threats from distane if they can. Both are more than able to stand their ground in close combat as well however.

Obregor, Male Kuru Brawler 7<br>

## Chorcat (Huntmaster, CR 10 alone)

A deadly huntsman, Chorcat is able to blend into shadows and almost disappear - striking like a snake to elimate isolated prey or capture it if necessary. He makes extensive use of the poisons that Yalok makes for the tribe to bring down foes many times his own strength.

## Standard hunting party (CR 7, CR 11 with Chorcat)

The hunting party's primary role in the tribe is to seek out food - often intelligent food. They work well together, co-ordinate their movements and strike from stealth whenever they can. They take much of their prey alive. Their teamwork feats key well off each other to enable them to be more than the sum of their parts. They also make good use of Yalok's poisons.

## Standard warparty (CR 6, CR 11 with Elites, CR 13 with Elite + Yalok)

This ius the main attac/defence forcefor the tribe, dealing with threats as and when needed. As such they are all skilled in other ways as well (NPC levels) unlike the more specialised humters.

## Guards (Each CR 4)

These toughs are in charge og guarding prisoners and providing security within the tribe.

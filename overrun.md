Siegebreaker Fighter 1 (Str 18, bull rush CMB = +7, Dmg = 6)<br>
Breaker Rush (Ex): At 1st level, a siegebreaker can attempt bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers without provoking attacks of opportunity. When he performs either combat maneuver, he deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to his Strength bonus (minimum 1). If he has Improved Bull Rush or Improved Overrun, the damage dealt by the appropriate maneuver increases by 2 and he adds any enhancement bonus from his armor or shield (though such enhancement bonuses do not stack, if both armor and shield are magic). This ability replaces the feat gained at 1st level.<br>
1: Power attack
H: Improved bull rush (Str 13, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1. Benefit: You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing an overrun combat maneuver. In addition, you receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrrun a foe. You also receive a +2 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever an opponent tries to overrun you. Targets of your overrun attempt may not chose to avoid you.)

Ftr 2 (Bull rush CMB = +8, Overrun +6, Bullrush dmg 6, + overrun 4)
Armored Vigor (Ex): At 2nd level as a swift action, a siegebreaker can gain 2 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier (minimum 1 per day), but only while wearing armor. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the number of temporary hit points the siegebreaker gains increases by 2, to a maximum of 10 at 18th level. This ability replaces bravery.
Breaker Momentum (Ex): At 2nd level, when a siegebreaker successfully bull rushes a foe, he can attempt an overrun combat maneuver check against that foe as a free action. This ability replaces the feat gained at 2nd level.

Ftr 3 (Bull rush CMB = +9, Overrun +7, Bullrush dmg 1d6+10, + overrun 4)
3: Spiked Destroyer (When you succeed at a bull rush or overrun combat maneuver, you may automatically make an attack roll with your armor spikes against the target of the maneuver as a swift action, using your highest attack bonus.)

Ftr 5: (Bull rush CMB = +11, Overrun +9, Bullrush dmg 1d6+10 +4 if CMB >5 more, + overrun 4)
5: Merciless Rush (When you bull rush a creature and your check exceeds the target’s CMD by 5 or more, you deal damage equal to your Strength modifier to that target.)


Ftr 6:
6: Quick Bull Rush (On your turn, you can perform a single bull rush combat maneuver in place of one of your melee attacks. You must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to make the bull rush.)

Ftr 7:
Greater Overrun (Prerequisites: Improved Overrun, Power Attack, base attack bonus +6, Str 13. Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Overrun. Whenever you overrun opponents, they provoke attacks of opportunity if they are knocked prone by your overrun.)
Bulette Charge Style (Prerequisites: Str 13, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, proficiency with heavy armor. Benefit: While using this style, you gain a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to overrun an opponent. Any magic ability or material that reduces your armor check penalty also reduces the bonus you gain for this style.)
7: Bulette Leap (Prerequisites: Str 15, Bulette Charge Style, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, proficiency with heavy armor. Benefit: While using Bulette Charge Style, you gain a bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump equal to your Strength bonus. Additionally, when you perform an overrun combat maneuver, you can attempt to overrun multiple foes, but you take a cumulative –2 penalty on each successive overrun attempt in the same round. If an overrun attempt fails, you cannot make any further attempts until your next round.)
8: Bulette Rampage (Prerequisites: Str 15, Bulette Charge Style, Bulette Leap, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, proficiency with heavy armor. Benefit: While you’re using Bulette Charge Style, whenever you succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check against a foe, that foe takes an amount of damage equal to 1d8 (if you’re Medium) or 1d6 (if you’re Small) + 1/2 your armor bonus to AC + 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. )

Tribal Scars Greattusk: (You gain a +2 bonus on checks to perform bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers and a +2 bonus on Ride checks.)
Charge Through (Prerequisites: Str 13, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1. Benefit: When making a charge, you can attempt to overrun one creature in the path of the charge as a free action. If you successfully overrun that creature, you can complete the charge. If the overrun is unsuccessful, the charge ends in the space directly in front of that creature. )

Siegebreaker Fighter 1 (Str 18, bull rush CMB = +7, Dmg = 6)
Breaker Rush (Ex): At 1st level, a siegebreaker can attempt bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers without provoking attacks of opportunity. When he performs either combat maneuver, he deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to his Strength bonus (minimum 1). If he has Improved Bull Rush or Improved Overrun, the damage dealt by the appropriate maneuver increases by 2 and he adds any enhancement bonus from his armor or shield (though such enhancement bonuses do not stack, if both armor and shield are magic). This ability replaces the feat gained at 1st level.
1: Power attack
H: Improved bull rush (Str 13, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1. Benefit: You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when performing an overrun combat maneuver. In addition, you receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrrun a foe. You also receive a +2 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever an opponent tries to overrun you. Targets of your overrun attempt may not chose to avoid you.)

Ftr 2 (Overrun CMB = +8, Bullrush +6, Bullrush dmg 4, + overrun 6)
Armored Vigor (Ex): At 2nd level as a swift action, a siegebreaker can gain 2 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Constitution modifier (minimum 1 per day), but only while wearing armor. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the number of temporary hit points the siegebreaker gains increases by 2, to a maximum of 10 at 18th level. This ability replaces bravery.
Breaker Momentum (Ex): At 2nd level, when a siegebreaker successfully bull rushes a foe, he can attempt an overrun combat maneuver check against that foe as a free action. This ability replaces the feat gained at 2nd level.

6: Greater Overrun (Prerequisites: Improved Overrun, Power Attack, base attack bonus +6, Str 13. Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe.

7: Bulette Leap (Prerequisites: Str 15, Bulette Charge Style, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, proficiency with heavy armor. Benefit: While using Bulette Charge Style, you gain a bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump equal to your Strength bonus. Additionally, when you perform an overrun combat maneuver, you can attempt to overrun multiple foes, but you take a cumulative –2 penalty on each successive overrun attempt in the same round. If an overrun attempt fails, you cannot make any further attempts until your next round.)

Charge Through (Prerequisites: Str 13, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1.
